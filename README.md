# numpy.random
My assignment on numpy.random as part of the Programming for Data Analysis 2019 module

This repository contains my assignment for the module Fundamentals of Data Analysis at GMIT. See here for the instructions: https://github.com/brianmcginley/ProgDA/raw/master/ProgDA_Assignment.pdf. References and resources I used in compiling this project are listed in the references section at the foot of this Readme file.

1. Go to GitHub.
2. Go to my repository: https://github.com/johndunne2019/numpy.random
3. Click the clone/download button.
4. Save the repository to a local folder location on your machine.
5. You will need to navigate to this folder location on the command line in order to run the program.
6. Details on how to run each individual script in this repository is included later in this Readme file.

## How to run the jupyter notebook
1. On the command line navigate to the folder location where the repository has been downloaded and saved to using the cd change directory command.
2. Type jupyter notebook on the command line and press enter
3. After a short wait jupyter notebook will open in your web browser. 
4. Open the numpy.random.ipynb notebook in the browser and the notebook containing the code and comments that I wrote for this assignment will be displayed.
5. if you want to run the code in any cell hold down the shift key and press enter and the command will run and the output wil be displayed in the next cell. 
6. To change between edit and read mode at any time press the ESC key.
7. When you have finished viewing the jupyter notebook close the web browser and return to the command line. Press Ctrl + C on the command line to kill the program.

## About this Assignment
This assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. In completing this assignment I will try to explain in detail the use of the numpy.random package in Python using explanations and examples. I will create a jupyter notebook and use this to show examples of numpy.random and its uses.

**There are 4 main sections in this assignment**
* Explain the overall use of the numpy.random package.
* Explain the use of the "Simple random data" and Permutations" functions.
* Explain the use and purpose of at least five "Distributions" functions.
* Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
