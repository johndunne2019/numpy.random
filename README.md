## About this Assignment
This assignment concerns the numpy.random package is Python. In completing this assignment I will try to explain in detail the use of the numpy.random package in Python using explanations and examples. I will create a jupyter notebook and use this to show examples of numpy.random and its uses.

**There are 4 main sections in this assignment**
* Explain the overall use of the numpy.random package.
* Explain the use of the "Simple random data" and Permutations" functions.
* Explain the use and purpose of at least five "Distributions" functions.
* Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
